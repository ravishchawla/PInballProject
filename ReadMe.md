Pinball Project
===============

Background
----------

Three balls lie in differnt corners of a triangle, and a pebble is shot at an angle towards one ball. As the pebble rejects the ball, it will shoot towards another ball, and reflect off to another, until eventually it escapes the parameter. 

This project attempts to find the best angle at which the the pebble can be shot, so that it acheives the most number of hits before it escapes. To compute this angle, a large number of simulations are run (as high as 1,000,000), and the best result is returned. The executable uses a text-based menu that allows the user to choose differnet ways to runt he program. 

The project can be run by running the executable file.
